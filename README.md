### Baby Feeder App
![](https://github.com/istoga/Baby-Feeding-Timer-Project/blob/main/Baby%20Feeder%20App.png)

This project assists mothers in keeping a detailed log of how often and for how long their baby breastfeeds.

The technologies used were JavaScript since computing power wouldn't be necessarily high and having quick loading times were more important.

Some of the future features anticipated are medication tracking and 
bottle feeding.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS
